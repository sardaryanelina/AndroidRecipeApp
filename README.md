John Abbott College
Final Project
Mobile Application Programming

Project Plan
1:
• Research and gather information on popular food recipe apps that are currently available, such as Spoonacular https://spoonacular.com/food-api, which eventually might be the final choice to be used.
• Define the scope and goals of the project, including the features and functionality that will be included in the app (might be slightly modified during the development process).
• Create a Git repository to track the project's progress and manage versions.
• Begin coding the app, implementing the basic features such as displaying recipes.
• Use Data Binding to bind the app's data to the user interface.
• Add a splash screen to create a better user experience.
2:
• Use RecyclerView to display a list of recipes in a scrollable and efficient way.
• Use MVVM architecture and LiveData to manage the app's data and state.
• Integrate Room database to store the recipe information.
• Implement Retrofit to fetch recipe data from a remote server by API call.
3:
• Begin unit testing for the app's core functionality.
• Continue working on developing the app, implementing more advanced features such as recipe categorization, searching, and filtering.
• Use Google Maps to display recipe locations.
• Begin Espresso testing to ensure the app's user interface is working correctly.
4:
• Finalize the design and user interface, making sure it is beautiful and polished.
• Perform final testing and debugging.
• Implement error handling.
• Prepare for app release on the Google Play Store.
